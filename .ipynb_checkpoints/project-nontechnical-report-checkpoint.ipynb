    "The purpose of this project is to create a song recommending system based on an existing playlist of songs. THe inspiration behind this project is the [Spotify Million Playlist Dataset Challenge](https://research.atspotify.com/the-million-playlist-dataset-remastered/). The data comes from sampling random existing Spotify playlists made by real users for Spotify's AI research (much of which focuses on recommendation systems).  "

    "The recommender uses a simple method based on the names and artists of songs found across multiple playlists in the dataset. Think of it like this: if playlist 1 has songs A, B, C, and C, and playlist 2 has songs A, B, and D, it would be logical that Playlist 2 would be recommended to add song C to its set."
